# Hob-lang
## Why?
Main idea hidden in the name of this lang. It is HOBBY language. It means that it creates only in recreaional purposes. I know what code is so bad, i want to refactor it in near future
## Getting Started
Requires GNU `gcc`, `cmake` and `llvm`
``` bash
mkdir .build
cd .build
cmake ../
cmake --build ./
./hoblang compile <source> <output>
```
## Syntax
look in examples :P
